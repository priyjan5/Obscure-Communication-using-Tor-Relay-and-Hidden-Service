# Obscure-Communication-using-Tor-Relay-and-Hidden-Service

**************************************************************************************************

Covert/Obscure Communication is a field in Information Security which is being extensively
researched and implemented as it has a signicant impact on today^as cyber age. With the
advent of quantum computing, socialfi networking, censorship and extensive surveillance; it
is becoming extremely arduous to preserve one^as privacy or maintain consistent anonymity
over the web. The idea of distributing information covertly has been practiced since ancient
times. Ancient Egyptians communicated covertly using the hieroglyphic script, a series of
symbols representing a message. The Greeks used ^ahidden writing^a which is the derivative
of steganography.

Even though it has become rudimentary knowledge that extensive surveillance leads to
Internet users being monitored, the Web having a distributed architecture becomes an
important medium which can be utilized to build obscure channels for communicating
covertly. The use of Internet infrastructure for building such a channel can be made to hide
information as well as communicate with enhanced privacy. Hence, the Internet can be
used to establish such channels to hide information and communicate privately between
two endpoints. Even though a major motivation for using such channels could be for
crime, hacking, espionage among others; covert channels and extensive applications in
military communications, privacy enhancing technologies, censorship circumvention and
cyber offense.

The purpose of this capstone project is to successfully establish an obscure communi-
cation system over the Onion Router network (Tor) using Tor Relays and Tor Hidden
Services. Tor is a privacy enhancing technology providing anonymity to its users. Hence
establishing an obscure channel using Tor infrastructure adds a strong layer of anonymity
and abstraction to the channel making the process of communication more difficult to detect.
This capstone project is unique, in the sense that, it has very intelligent design and its
successful implementation explores an undertaking not researched before.

• The goal of this project :

This capstone aims to establish an obscure/covert communication system between
two entities Alice and Bob using the Onion Router (Tor) infrastructure. Onion URLs
for Hidden Services have to be made available to the Tor users out of band. This
capstone aims to obscure an Hidden Service's onion URL by encoding it and including
it in the Tor network's meta-data.

• The rationale of the project :
This capstone has been designed to use the anonymity provided by the Tor network
and build an extra layer of obscurity over the anonymity layer to enable hidden/covert
communication between two entities.
A Threat Model that considers malicious Hidden Service Directory Servers, critical
to Hidden Service Operations, has been developed and is necessary to be mitigated
for successful implementation of the obscure communication system to successfully
function.

• The importance of the project :
Upon careful and successful deployment, this obscure communication system can be
used for covert activities to be used for defense projects, to communicate within the
Tor infrastructure and even military operations overseas.
Any communication system between base and remote military locations can modify
this communication system and deploy it for obscure communications as this system
is built upon the anonymity of the Tor network.

• Main contributions to the project :
Designing the entire obscure communication system using Tor infrastructure which
has never been undertaken before.
Hosting a live Tor Relay and a live Tor Hidden Service on the internet.
Writing scripts for obscuring the access to the Hidden Service.
Testing the obscure communication system as it is live on the internet.
